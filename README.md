# SDP: Sensing Data-Protocol for Scalable Wireless Sensing

**SDP (Sensing Data-Protocol)** is a **protocol-level abstraction framework and unified benchmark** for **scalable wireless sensing and perception** based on wireless signals such as **Channel State Information(CSI)**.
The protocol is designed to **decouple learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts**, enabling **fair, reproducible, and scalable evaluation** of deep learning models for wireless sensing tasks.

SDP enforces **deterministic physical-layer sanitization**, **canonical tensor construction**, and **standardized training and evaluation procedures**, making it particularly suitable for **wireless sensing research**, **activity recognition**, **device-free sensing**, and **cross-dataset benchmarking**.

Our pipeline and main result can be illustrated by the following two pictures.

## 🔍 Why SDP?

Wireless sensing research often suffers from:
- Inconsistent **hardware configurations**
- Dataset-specific **preprocessing pipelines**
- Non-reproducible **training and evaluation protocols**

**SDP addresses these challenges at the protocol level**, rather than the model level.

### Core Design Principles
- **Protocol-level abstraction**
- **Deterministic PHY-layer sanitization** to eliminate randomness
- **Canonical tensor representation** for deep learning compatibility
- **Unified benchmark pipeline** across datasets and tasks
- **Extensible architecture** for new datasets, processors, and models

## 🧠 Target Use Cases

SDP is optimized for:
- CSI-based **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)**
- **Gait recognition** and biometric identification
- **Wireless sensing + deep learning** research
- **Cross-domain / cross-hardware generalization**
- **scalable sensing systems**

Typical downstream models include CNNs, Transformers, BiLSTMs, GNNs, and hybrid architectures.

## 📁 Project Structure Overview

### `algorithms/` - Algorithm Storage

Store various functions for implementing different signal processing algorithms. 

- `./denoising.py`  
  Store functions for signal denoising and support extension
- `./phase_calibration.py`  
  Store functions for phase calibration and support extension

---

### `data/` – Dataset Storage

**Important**:
- Data from the same sampling project **must be placed in the same subfolder** and **be the same format**
- Mixing formats across folders may lead to **ignored files and exceptions**

---

### `readers/`
- Store Dataset-specific readers
- Converts raw files into `List` of `CSIData`
- Extensible via factory registration in file `__init__.py`

---

### `results/`
- Store confusion matrix and checkpoints of best models

---

### `structure/`
- Definition of `CSIData` and all kinds of `CSIFrame`

---

### `processor.py`
- concurrent signal processing and sanitization modules
- Enforces deterministic PHY-layer preprocessing
- Task-aware for labels

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install Dependencies
Create a venv for dependencies, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Data
Please download needed datasets from [Our SDP Website](http://sdp8.org/) or other source and put them into `data/your subfolder`.

### Preprocess
Considering that there are countless lines of print when processing thousands of files, in your venv, the below is recommended:

```bash
# Check the params first, especially for file path :)
nohup python preprocess.py >> output.log 2>&1 &
```

### Train and Eval
Now that you get `processed_data.npz`, run:

```bash
# Also, check the params :)
python main.py
```

## 📚 Guide for extension
1. Add new frame in `structure/CSIFrame`
2. Add new reader in `readers/` and register in `__init__.py`
3. Add new lines for extracting labels and groups in `processor.py`
4. **(Option)** Create new .py file or add new functions for signal processing in existed files in `algorithms/` for extension.
